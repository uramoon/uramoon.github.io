The Data Mining Lab, led by [Prof. Seung-Hyun Moon]({{ '/members/shmoon' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}), is affiliated with the [School of Software ](https://www.kw.ac.kr/en/univ/electronic05_1.jsp){:target="\_blank"} within the [College of Artificial Intelligence and Convergence](https://www.kw.ac.kr/en/univ/Software_glance.jsp){:target="\blank"} at [Kwangwoon University](https://www.kw.ac.kr/en/){:target="\blank"}.

Our primary focus is in the field of data mining, where we utilize machine learning and evolutionary computation techniques. Additionally, we engage in research on data-driven financial engineering.

We are currently developing an AI-based decision support system for maritime search and rescue in collaboration with [OPTLAB](https://kwoptlab.kr){:target="\blank"}, as well as technology for AI-based artwork data acquisition, management, and value analysis in partnership with [ETRI](https://etri.re.kr){:target="\blank"}.
