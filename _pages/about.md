The Data Mining Lab, led by [Prof. Seung-Hyun Moon]({{ '/people' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}), is affiliated with the [School of Software ](https://www.kw.ac.kr/en/univ/electronic05_1.jsp){:target="\_blank"} within the [College of Artificial Intelligence and Convergence](https://www.kw.ac.kr/en/univ/Software_glance.jsp){:target="\blank"} at [Kwangwoon University](https://www.kw.ac.kr/en/){:target="\blank"}.

Our focus lies in the realm of data mining, where we employ machine learning and evolutionary computation techniques. In addition, we delve into research in data-driven financial engineering.

We are also working on the development of an AI-based decision support system for maritime search and rescue in collaboration with [OPTLAB](https://kwoptlab.kr){:target="\blank"}.
