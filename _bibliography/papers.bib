abstract = {The purpose of an early warning system (EWS) is to issue warning signals prior to extreme events. Extreme weather events, however, are hard to predict due to their chaotic behavior. This paper suggests a method for an effective EWS for very short-term heavy rainfall with machine learning techniques. The EWS produces a warning signal when it is expected to reach the criterion for a heavy rain advisory within the next 3 h. We devised a selective discretization method that converts a subset of continuous input variables to nominal ones. Meteorological data obtained from automatic weather stations are preprocessed by the selective discretization and principal component analysis. As a classifier, logistic regression is used to predict whether or not a warning is required. A comparative evaluation was performed on the EWS models generated by various classifiers. The tests were run for 652 locations in South Korea from 2007 to 2012. The empirical results showed that the preprocessing methods improved the prediction quality and logistic regression works well on heavy rainfall nowcasting in terms of F-measure and equitable threat score.}

ABSTRACT = {In this study, we estimated drifter tracking over seawater using machine learning and evolutionary search techniques. The parameters used for the prediction are the hourly position of the drifter, the wind velocity, and the flow velocity of each drifter position. Our prediction model was constructed through cross-validation. Trajectories were affected by wind velocity and flow velocity from the starting points of drifters. Mean absolute error (MAE) and normalized cumulative Lagrangian separation (NCLS) were used to evaluate various prediction models. Radial basis function network showed the lowest MAE of 0.0556, an improvement of 35.20% over the numerical model MOHID. Long short-term memory showed the highest NCLS of 0.8762, an improvement of 6.24% over MOHID.},

abstract = {We use machine learning to generate binary forecasts of the occurrence of lightning within a particular location and time interval. The training data is weather variables found in the forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts, correlated against subsequent lightning reports, for a region containing the Korean Peninsula. Lightning is uncommon, so the amount of data which does not involve lightning tends to swamp the training process. Thus we only consider spatial locations at which lightning frequently occurs, and we also undersample the subset of the remaining data-points which are not associated with lightning. Results from support vector machines and random forests had equitable threat scores of 0.0885 and 0.0828, respectively. The ETS of results from SVMs can be increased to 0.1241 if temporal resolution is reduced by a factor of 2, and 0.1499 if spatial resolution is reduced by a factor of 3.}

ABSTRACT = {The lidar ceilometer estimates cloud height by analyzing backscatter data. This study examines weather detectability using a lidar ceilometer by making an unprecedented attempt at detecting weather phenomena through the application of machine learning techniques to the backscatter data obtained from a lidar ceilometer. This study investigates the weather phenomena of precipitation and fog, which are expected to greatly affect backscatter data. In this experiment, the backscatter data obtained from the lidar ceilometer, CL51, installed in Boseong, South Korea, were used. For validation, the data from the automatic weather station for precipitation and visibility sensor PWD20 for fog, installed at the same location, were used. The experimental results showed potential for precipitation detection, which yielded an F1 score of 0.34. However, fog detection was found to be very difficult and yielded an F1 score of 0.10.},

abstract = {Accurate prediction of precipitation type is an important part of weather forecasting. But using meteorological insight to make such predictions from a small set of weather variables achieves only limited success. We use correlation-based feature selection to assemble an effective subset of the large number of weather variables available in short-range weather forecasts, and from these we obtain the coefficients for multinomial regression, which can then be used to predict precipitation type. We applied this approach to data for significant locations in South Korea, obtained from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and from the Regional Data Assimilation and Prediction System, and achieved predictions which are respectively 15% and 13% more accurate than those contained in the original forecasts.}

Overall, the mean absolute error was approximately 15\% lower when the genetic algorithm-applied feature selection method was used.

ABSTRACT = {Feature selection reduces the dimension of input variables by eliminating irrelevant features. We propose feature selection techniques based on a genetic algorithm, which is a metaheuristic inspired by a natural selection process. We compare two types of feature selection for predicting a stock market index and cryptocurrency price. The first method is a newly devised genetic filter involving a fitness function designed to increase the relevance between the target and the selected features and decrease the redundancy between the selected features. The second method is a genetic wrapper, whereby we can find the better feature subsets related to KOPSI by exploring the solution space more thoroughly. Both genetic feature selection methods improved the predictive performance of various regression functions. Our best model was applied to predict the KOSPI, cryptocurrency price, and their respective trends after COVID-19.},

abstract = {In this study, a genetic algorithm-based filter feature selection was applied to the data on the rates of change in various economic indices used worldwide to predict the rates of change of the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI). The fitness function is composed of a combination of the results of information gains, F-test, and correlation coefficients. Data for the past 12 years (from 2007 to 2018) were divided into sections according to the yearly time intervals, and feature selection was applied to the data in each section. It was found that the amount of calculation time required for a genetic filter was approximately 75\% lower compared to that required for a previous genetic wrapper. It was also found that the mean absolute error of the genetic filter was approximately 26\% lower compared to that of the genetic wrapper. The analytic results verified that the genetic filter exhibited better calculation performance and required less time to calculate the optimal solution. Furthermore, a new combination of features related to the KOSPI was obtained.},

ABSTRACT = {Online portfolio selection (OLPS) is a procedure for allocating portfolio assets using only past information to maximize an expected return. There have been successful mean reversion strategies that have achieved large excess returns on the traditional OLPS benchmark datasets. We propose a genetic mean reversion strategy that evolves a population of portfolio vectors using a hybrid genetic algorithm. Each vector represents the proportion of the portfolio assets, and our strategy chooses the best vector in terms of the expected returns on every trading day. To test our strategy, we used the price information of the S&amp;P 500 constituents from 2000 to 2017 and compared various strategies for online portfolio selection. Our hybrid genetic framework successfully evolved the portfolio vectors; therefore, our strategy outperformed the other strategies when explicit or implicit transaction costs were incurred.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurate wind data are crucial for successful search and rescue (SAR) operations on the sea surface in maritime accidents, as survivors or debris tend to drift with the wind. As maritime accidents frequently occur outside the range of wind stations, SAR operations heavily rely on wind forecasts generated by numerical models. However, numerical models encounter delays in generating results due to spin-up issues, and their predictions can sometimes exhibit inherent biases caused by geographical factors. To overcome these limitations, we reviewed the observations for the first 24 h of the 72-hour forecast from the ECMWF and then post-processed the forecast for the remaining 48 h. By effectively reducing the dimensionality of input variables comprising observation and forecast data using principal component analysis, we improved wind predictions with support vector regression. Our model achieved an average RMSE improvement of 16.01% compared to the original forecast from the ECMWF. Furthermore, it achieved an average RMSE improvement of 5.42% for locations without observation data by employing a model trained on data from the nearest wind station and then applying an adaptive weighting scheme to the output of that model.},
